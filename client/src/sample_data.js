    body: `I spend so long looking for the perfect sofa: fabric that was dark & tightly weaved enough to be toddler/cat friendly, big enough for all of us to watch tv together but not take up the whole room, classic design elements that fit with modern decor, soft but still has those clean lines. This is perfect. I got dark gray w/ light wood legs, a few throw pillows of differing sizes and textures, and a big faux fur sheepskin to drape over the back so my cats can lounge without getting their fur everywhere.`,
